# Jupyter-Notebooks

Here I store my Jupyter Notebooks. 

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook installation details can be found [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). 

The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (*Windows*) or by typing `jupyter notebook` in a terminal (*UNIX*).

## 1. algorithms

In this folder, I store tests of algorithms that I implement and examples of their applications.

### - CubicSplineInterpolation
 
Test of my implementation of cubic spline interpolation numerical method. This method gives an interpolating polynomial that is smoother and has smaller error than some other interpolating polynomials such as Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial ([2](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cubic_Spline_Interpolation)).
 
### - EulerMethod
 
Test of my implementation of Euler numerical method.
 
### - TrapeziumMethod
 
Test of my implementation of numerical integration Trapezium method.
 
### - ViterbiAlgorithm
 
## 2. neuroscience

### - [NeurofeedbackEvents](https://github.com/BasilMinkov/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/neuroscience/NeurofeedbackEvents.ipynb) 
 
 Post-recording events search and computation of event related potentials (ERP).
 
### - [HamsterWithTorpor](https://github.com/BasilMinkov/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/neuroscience/HamsterWithTorpor.ipynb)
### - [SpikingNeuronsInH2O2](https://github.com/BasilMinkov/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/neuroscience/SpikingNeuronsInH2O2.ipynb)
### - [HamsterWithoutTorpor](https://github.com/BasilMinkov/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/neuroscience/HamsterWithoutTorpor.ipynb)
 
## 3. statistics

### - MuSigmaEstimation
### - ProjectStatistics1
### - ProjectStatistics2
